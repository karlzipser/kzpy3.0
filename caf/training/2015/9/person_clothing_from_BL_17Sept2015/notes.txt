Training person_clothes_from_BL_17Sept2015

goal: start with fine tune Barry Lyndon weights model_from_scratch_rot_conv_iter_33000.caffemodel
(these are not reall rot_conv), which is actually something like 600k iterations, and use it
to start training the person task, then compare with the training from scratch.

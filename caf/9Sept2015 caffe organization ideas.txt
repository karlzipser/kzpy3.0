There is a lot of stuff to organize for caffe. Big stuff like image folders and databases
should be local on scratch. Caffe is local, but all the rest should be on Google drive or github.
Note that to work on the cluster, we don't want to use Google drive, or we need to manually copy stuff.

I want to be able to control cluster learning by editing local files (solver, train_val) and syncing with git.


train.py
train_gpu.py
train_from_scratch_gpu.py
rcaf.sh

I guess I don't want to use the models folder for training, only for finished models, to avoid clutter.
